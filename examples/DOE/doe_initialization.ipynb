    "# Design of Experiments for Reaction Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DOE in Reaction Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Design of experiments is commonly utilized for the optimization of process parameters in chemistry. In general, an experimental design will be executed, the results used to build a model, and the model used to predict optimal conditions. However, the process of running DOE for a given system relies heavily on operator intuition and experience. What type of design to use? How to treat categorical variables? How to model responses? These questions and more require answers for a given application. In this demo, we will standardize this practice for the purposes of reproducibility and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we benchmark DOE as an optimization methodology. The simulation design is: (1) run $M$ experiments associated with an experimental design, (2) train a quadratic model using the data, and (3) predict the $N = B - M$ best conditions (where $B$ is the number of experiments in the budget). Then the best observed yield distribution in the experimental data can be compared to Bayesian optimization (BO) using the same number of experiments. We will also take this time to go ahead and develop a general DOE framework compatible with edbo, as such methods could be quite useful for initializing BO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since many optimization reaction spaces are built from categorical variables, we will need to use designs compatible with this data type. For example, since response surface designs (e.g., central composite) require a sense of order and factorial designs require the use of only 2 levels, these designs are not readily adaptable to typical synthetic tasks. Hence DOE is typically only used for optimizations over continuous variables). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fractional Factorial Design**. One design compatible with multilevel categorical variables is the *Generalized Subset Design* (GSD). GSD is a generalization of traditional fractional factorial designs to problems where factors can have more than two levels. **These designs were actually developed specifically for chemistry!**\n",

    "\n",
    "*Implementation:* https://github.com/clicumu/pyDOE2\n",
    "\n",
    "**D-Optimal Design**. D-optimal designs are computer-aided designs which can be utilized when classical designs fail (e.g., reaction optimization with categorical variables). These designs have been employed effectively towards the optimization of chemical processes. We will employ Federov's exchange algorithm to calculate the approximate design for each reaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling**. For the modeling we will utilize a polynomial model (up to quadratic terms) since this is typical in DOE as a means to capture interactions. We will OHE the data sets since most applications do not utilize chemical descriptors (Note that this method is fully compatible with any encoding though).\n"

    "## Build Search Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "One point of variability in these types of designs, is that the ordering of the levels is arbitrary. That is, the design you end up with will depend upon the order in which you list the components in each category. This of course is not a desirable feature as different users may list their reagents in a different order for the same reaction space. Thus to gauge the variance in outcome to the ordering of the categorical variables we can simply shuffle the data.\n"

    "For each of the reactions in the development set you can see that the GSD baed DOE optimization was able to identify the global maximum in some instances. However, upon the shuffling of levels there was a considerable amount of variance in outcome observed. Therefore, while the difference in mean optimization outcome between the two methods are small in some instances (e.g., reaction 2d), the difference between the worst case outcomes was singificantly larger. For each reaction, the statistics tell us: (1) BO performs better on average (p-values < 0.05 in all cases), (2) BO has less variance in outcome even with randomly selected initial conditions, and (3) BO has a better worst case scenario (close to the global max yield)."

    "For each of the reactions in the development set you can see that the D-Optimal DOE optimization was able to identify the global maximum in some or many instances. However, upon the shuffling of levels there was a considerable amount of variance in outcome observed. Therefore, while the difference in mean optimization outcome between the two methods is small and not statistically significant in the case of reaction 2b, the difference between the worst-case outcomes was still large. For each reaction, the statistics tell us: (1) BO performs somewhat better on average (p-values < 0.05 in 5 out of 6 cases), (2) BO has less variance in outcome even with randomly selected initial conditions and more simulations, and (3) BO has a better worst case scenario (close to the global max yield).\n"
